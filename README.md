# UDACITY frontend-nanodegree-feedreader-master-js

## Why this Project?

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What we learned

We learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These tested the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests gives us the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within the codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
